# Notes - Algorithms

This repository includes notes about algorithms, mostly obtained from [Grooking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230), and from some other Internet resources.

> According to 'Programming Pearls', only 10% of professional programmers are able to implement binary search in their code. They can explain it very well, but coding it is a challenge for them.

Each folder follows the chapter structure of the book, and includes:

1. Summary as markdown
2. Summary as PDF
3. Code examples in Python
4. Code examples in Ruby
5. Images and charts related with the chapter.
